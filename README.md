We have used CSS Grid to design kijiji.ca.
Particulary this specific webpage: https://www.kijiji.ca/b-mississauga-peel-region/house/k0l1700276?ll=43.589045%2C-79.644120&address=Mississauga%2C+ON&radius=20.0&dc=true

It works perfectly will all major desktop browsers except Internet Explorer. 
The website not responsive and will not work on small screen devices on any browser. 
The website is also not dynamic.
